# WebTechnology

I colaborated with three other people on a web technology project.

It is a website made from scratch using HTML, PHP, Javascript, CSS and SQL.

It has a system to login, chat with other users and it fetches the news using an API.

It was hosted using Apache, but it is offline right now.
